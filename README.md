This project is based on an example and dataset from Data Science course developed at Berkeley (Data8.org).

NearestNeighborClassification.py contains the functions needed to use the Nearest Neighbor and K-Nearest Neighbor classification methods on a set of data. It contains the functions:
- openckdfile - retrieves the data set on chronic kidney disease diagnonses.
- normalizeData - takes arrays of data and creates new arrays of the normalized values of the data.
- graphData - generates a scatter plot of the inputted data that is colorcoded based on points' classifications.
- createTestCase - randomly generates two floats between 0 and 1 that serve as a random set of normalized glucose and hemoglobin levels.
- calculateDistanceArray - generates an array that contains the distances between an inputted point and all points in an inputted data set.
- nearestNeighborClassifier - uses the calculateDistanceArray function then finds the index of the minimum distance in the array and uses it to find the classification of the point in the data set with that index.
- graphTestCase - similar to graphData but it also graphs the inputted test case as a magenta star.

kNearestNeighborClassifier - uses the calculateDistanceArray function, sorts the distance array's indices from minimum to maximum, selects the first k indices, finds and sorts the classifications associated with those indices then finds the median classification which is also the mode.

  - Returns: This is a void function.

KMeansClustering_driver.py is the script for using the K-Means Clustering classification method on a data set with two features. This script calls functions from KMeansClustering_functions.py and uses a while loop that ends when the centroids do not change after the most recent Update step. At the beginning of the while loop, it compares "initial centroid values" to the "normalized centroid values". If the condition is true, the "initial centroid values" are updated to have the same values as the "normalized centroid values", the mean values are calculated for each cluster, and the "normalized centroid values" are updated to be the calculated mean values. Once the mean values for the clusters stop changing the "initial centroid values" and "normalized centroid values" will be equal and the loop will end.

To run the KMeansClustering_driver.py, make k in line 11 equal the number of clusters you want to be found. If you choose a number other than 2, I suggest commenting out the kmc.calculateAccuracy() function in line 41 or else it will print out the error messages I wrote into the function. When the program runs, it will print out the random normalized values that the generated centroids start as, the final normalized values of the centroids, the final unscaled values of the centroids, the classifications of the points in the data set based on the generated clusters, a normalized graph of the clusters and centroids, an unscaled graph of the clusters and centroids, and the accuracy rates. Sometimes the resulting classification numbers assigned to the clusters will be flipped compared to the actual classfications which will cause the calculated accuracy rates to switch with each other (ex. True Positives Rate switches with False Negatives Rate).
